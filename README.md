# Discount Demo (SOLID Principles)

This is a demonstration project showcasing a clean, extensible discount system architecture based on **SOLID principles**.
It was built to accompany the article ["When E-Commerce Turns into a Nightmare: Why I Rebuilt Discounts the SOLID Way"](https://medium.com/@oleg_64514/when-e-commerce-turns-into-a-nightmare-why-i-rebuilt-discounts-the-solid-way-6a2476739e5c).

> âš¡ Note: This is a **demo**, not a production-ready package. However, the structure is suitable for integrating into real applications.
